# Sniper

Sniper is a lightweight compliance tool that monitors employee login/logout behavior and system activity to assess productivity and detect anomalies. It calculates total work hours, analyzes active engagement, and flags irregular patterns like low activity or overnight usage. With automated reporting and audit trails, Sniper supports internal audits, remote work monitoring, and HR compliance actions.
